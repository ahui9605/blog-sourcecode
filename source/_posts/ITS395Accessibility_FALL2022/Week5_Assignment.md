This week, we are focusing primarily on the types of accessibility features for users with varying physical disabilities. The accessibility features that we require to create it uniquely for each individual or to optimize its features. To determine which accessibility option is optimal for them. We must comprehend the nature of their infirmities.
Motor Disability refers to any disorder that hinders sensation, movement, or coordination. These disabilities can originate from a variety of causes, including congenital diseases, illnesses, and physical trauma, but they typically present similar obstacles to web browsing.

Possible well-fitted accessibility for physical injuries and impairments:

- Cerebral palsy is a damage to the brain that causes a loss of muscle control.
- Muscular dystrophy is a hereditary condition that affects the genes that regulate the creation of muscle protein.
- Back Spine, partly congenital disorder in which the spine fails to fully wrap around the spinal cord during the first trimester of pregnancy, resulting in some loss of physical movement.

Some assistive devices can give an acceptable or above-average level of accessibility. Head wands and mouth sticks, which go over the head or into the mouth and extend toward a control interface, are a common form of assistive technology.

The user can manage an adaptive computer mouse, keyboard, or other assistive equipment by manipulating a wand or stick with their neck and jaw muscles. Additionally, there is the adaptable keyboard. Word-completion technology and elevated spaces between keys that allow users to rest their hands in position when not typing or during muscle spasms may be included. Those with minimal or no hand control may benefit from eye-tracking gadgets, which allow them to use eye movement to navigate the web. Different forms of accessibility tools are evolving and being applied to everyone; what we need to do is give them with a better web-using experience, possibly extending to other areas of use.

Cognitive problems typically have a negative impact on the way information is processed. A wide variety of aspects, such as people's perceptions, memories, languages, attention, ability to solve problems, and comprehension levels. People will be able to have a better experience and more opportunities to connect with content. Additionally, they will be able to process information in ways that are more useful to them thanks to the technology. In order to provide those who have cognitive or learning disabilities with the best possible user experience, it is a good idea, for instance, to direct them to simplified web material that provides them with the option to access information in both text and audio form.

People need to get started working on this area of study in order to find a solution to the significant problem of limited accessibility of mental health user services. The majority of the research and study is focused on how to improve the online content so that people who use it for mental health purposes can locate resources on the site that will help them relieve their stress and anxiety. Nonetheless, there is a certain aspect of access such as the special features only designed to mental health user is still not applicable to be use.

A user is said to have non-literacy or illiteracy if they are incapable of reading and comprehending the intricate or profound meaning of the language they use. The simple text, accompanied by graphics that help to visualize it, or a brief movie that contains as little words as possible but yet conveys the information effectively may be one way to help them grasp it better.

People of a greater age certainly experienced a loss of body function, which may also entail a loss of physical function. Do provide the accessibility, such as simple interaction with the website, alternatives for increasing the text size with only the click of a button, and the ability to alert them with a larger feedback reflection.

Users with a high sensitivity to motion risk experiencing discomfort or even physical injury from interactions with moving objects. So in order to accommodate motion-sensitive users, both CSS and iOS 7 have included a function that allows users to turn off unwanted motion.
