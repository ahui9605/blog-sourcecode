21. <b>Describe at least four differences between direct touch screen interaction and interaction in using VoiceOver or TalkBack on iOS or Android devices.</b>

    Direct touch screen interaction and interaction on iOS or Android devices with VoiceOver or TalkBack differ in a number of ways. Among the most significant variations are:

    - Feedback: Direct touch screen interaction is an input method where users enter commands by touching the screen with their fingers. Users can enter commands by speaking aloud or using gestures with VoiceOver or TalkBack.
    - Direct touch screen interaction provides users with visual feedback that they can see by staring at the screen. Users who use VoiceOver or TalkBack hear spoken words or other sounds as auditory feedback.
    - Navigation: With direct touch screen interaction, users swipe or tap the screen to move around the user interface. Users can use voice commands or gestures to navigate when using VoiceOver or TalkBack.
    - Accessibility: Users with specific disabilities, such as those who are blind or have low vision, may find direct touch screen interaction inaccessible. On the other hand, VoiceOver and TalkBack are specifically made for people who have vision problems, and they offer accessibility features like text-to-speech, screen magnification, and braille support.

    Overall, the input method, feedback, navigation, and accessibility are the main differences between direct touch screen interaction and interaction using VoiceOver or TalkBack on iOS or Android devices. These variations may have an impact on the user experience and may necessitate that users change how they interact with the device in order to make the most of it.

22. <b>Describe at least four problems that may arise in using Youtube's automatic speech recognition feature.</b>

    When using YouTube's automatic speech recognition (ASR) feature, a number of issues could occur. These issues might make it difficult for users to use the ASR feature effectively and may affect the accuracy and value of the transcriptions. Among the crucial issues are:

    - Accurate transcription: Using ASR technology presents a number of challenges, including the need for high accuracy in the transcription of spoken words. ASR systems occasionally make transcription errors, which can lead to inaccurate or deceptive transcriptions.
    - Background noise: ASR can have trouble accurately transcribing speech in the presence of background noise, which is another issue with the technology. For instance, the ASR system might struggle to accurately transcribe the speech if there is music or other background noise in a video.
    - Different accents and languages: Because ASR systems are typically trained on a particular accent and language, they may struggle to accurately transcribe speech in these situations. Users with different accents or who speak different languages may find it difficult to use the ASR feature as a result, which can result in inaccurate transcriptions.
    - Limited functionality: ASR systems are primarily used to transcribe speech and do not typically offer any other features. For instance, speaker identification or other contextual information cannot be automatically generated by ASR systems in captions. As a result, the transcriptions may be less useful and may be more challenging for users to comprehend and utilize effectively.

23. <b>Explain what is ARIA -- and give at least two examples.</b>

    The Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite (ARIA), is a set of technical guidelines that specify how to make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. Web developers can use other web accessibility standards like HTML and CSS to create more inclusive and user-friendly web experiences by utilizing ARIA attributes and roles.

    The following are some instances of ARIA attributes and roles:

    - Using the "aria-label" attribute, you can give a text label to a web page element like a button or form field. This can aid users who are blind in comprehending the function of the element and interacting with it appropriately.
    - Use the "role" attribute to specify an element's function or purpose on a web page. An element's "role" attribute, for instance, can be used to specify whether it's a form field, a button, or a navigation menu. This can make it easier for users with disabilities to interact with the website and understand its organization and structure.

24. <b>Give four improvements in WCAG 3.0 over 2.x, per the article, "The Future of Web Accessibility".</b>

    Some of the features from WCAG2.1 will be carried over to the new standard, but there will also be some new features. But since the standard has changed from A, AA, and AAA to a number score. It is the number that goes from the lowest possible score on the standard to the highest possible score. Its purpose is to show how important and necessary it is to measure accessibility. It is more flexible, which made it easier for both users and developers to understand how to measure the accessibility standard. It also made the product easier to use.

    Because the WCAG2.x standard is hard to fully understand, the readability will be changed in a big way. So, the members are thinking about adding symbols and letters that are easier to understand and make more sense so that people who are reading the WCAG for the first time can understand it quickly. It is possible, among other things, to get rid of some unnecessary contexts and rebuild the category class.

    The standard has also been made stricter, such that if one fatal had been made, even if it's just one fatal mistake, the corresponding standard will drop down to a score of zero, and it will be marked as inaccessible.
    It adds a new standard known as conformance, which rates websites as Bronze, Silver, or Gold according to the WCAG3.0 Draft. The WCAG3.0 minimum requirement for conformance is called bronze, and the best conformance level is called gold. Bronze is the lowest level of conformance that can be achieved.

25. <b>Per the article, "Accessible Images For When They Matter Most", explain why it is appropriate for some images to be labeled "Decorative Images" and therefore does not need to be described.</b>

    Some images should be called "decorative images" and not be described because they don't give the user any important information or functionality. Most of the time, decorative images are used for their looks, like to add visual interest or improve the look of a web page. They don't help the user understand or interact with the content. So, it's not necessary to explain what these images are because they don't do anything useful and aren't important to the user's experience.

    Labeling an image as "decorative" can help people with disabilities who use tools like screen readers to get to web content. When a screen reader comes across an image that has been marked as decorative, it can be set to ignore it and not try to describe it. This can help the user see less information that isn't important or isn't relevant and make it easier for them to focus on the most important information. So, calling images "decorative" is the right thing to do when they don't give the user any important information or functionality. This can help make web content more accessible and easier to use for people with disabilities.

26. <b>In the article, "Keyboard-only" Navigation for Improved Accessibility, explain why they recommend using a "Skip Navigation Link".</b>

    Putting a "skip navigation link" on a web page is a good idea because it can make the page easier for people with disabilities to access and use. A skip navigation link is a link that lets users skip a web page's main navigation menu and go straight to the main content. This can be especially helpful for users who need help getting to web content, like those who use screen readers.

    Screen readers usually read web content in a straight line, from the top of the page to the bottom. This means that people who use screen readers must hear the whole navigation menu before they can get to the page's main content. This can take time and be annoying, especially if the user knows the site well and already knows where they want to go. Users can skip the navigation menu and go straight to the content they want to see with a "skip navigation" link. This makes it easier and faster for them to find the information they need.

    Overall usability and access for people with disabilities of a website by giving users a way to get around the main navigation menu, "skip navigation" links can make it easier and faster for them to get to the content they want. They can also make the user experience better and less frustrating. These links can be especially helpful for people who use assistive technology like screen readers or who have trouble navigating the web with a mouse or other pointing device. Because of this, skip navigation links are often recommended as a best practice for making web content more accessible.
