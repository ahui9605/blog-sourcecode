- 13.1 Compare WCAG 3.0 with WCAG 2.1 (C?)
- 13.2 Describe future possibilities of web accessibility standards (C?)

The accessibility standard that is in effect right now is WCAG2.1. In addition, the WCAG2.2 will receive its final update some time before end of the year 2022. Accessibility for all disabled people is also required to catch up with the rapid advancement of technology in order to guarantee that all users will have full access to the internet's vast resources. As a result, the members who work for the WCAG are currently developing the new standard known as WCAG 3.0. It was stated in one of the articles that the publication wouldn't be considered official until 2023. The WCAG3.0 document is still in the stage of being a working draft, and additional new ideas or some functions still need to be revised and some changes made to them. The draft is available to be viewed online.

The newly developed standard will incorporate some features that are new, in addition to those that have been carried over from WCAG2.1. However, due to the fact that the standard changes from A, AA, and AAA to the number score. It is the number that ranges from the lowest possible score to the highest possible score on the standard, and its purpose is to provide a better description of how important and necessary it is to measure accessibility. It is more flexible, which allowed users and developers to have a better understanding of how to use the accessibility standard, and it also improved the accessibility of the product. Nevertheless, this is not the final decision, and the members are still discussing about it.

The readability will undergo significant revisions as a result of the fact that fully comprehending the WCAG2.x standard is not an easy task. Therefore, the members are considering to add the simplified symbols and letters, with a natural sense to ensure that those who are reading the WCAG for the first time can quickly understand what they are reading. It is possible to eliminate some superfluous contexts and reconstruct the category class, among other things.

The standard has also been made stricter, such that if one fatal had been made, even if it's just one fatal mistake, the corresponding standard will drop down to a score of zero, and it will be marked as inaccessible.

In summary, it will be a great updated and improvement version of the WCAG standard for people who are disabled, with more features being added, as well as a revision of some of the unnecessary standards from the previous version of WCAG and the older version. Therefore, with this standard improvement, we should also spread the standard, ensure that almost all websites have sufficient accessibility, and enhance the browsing experience for people with disabilities.
