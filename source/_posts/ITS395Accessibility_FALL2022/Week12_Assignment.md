- 12.1 Identify corporate approaches to implementing web accessibility (C?)
- 12.2 Describe the challenges for implementing web accessibility (C?)

The majority of nations have enacted legislation that safeguard the civil rights of disabled people in homes, parks, businesses, and educational institutions. Access to websites and applications hosted on the internet is not universal. But for now It had been done for a long time ago by the federal and government department where involved with lots of disabled employees and more diversity of disabled employees, the accessibility has been adding more over the course of the last two decades. However, certain rules, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 508, do not apply to the internet services in question, which include video streaming as well as social media websites and applications. These apps and web were supposed to be an efficient means of communication, making it possible for all of the information to be made available to everyone. However, these businesses have a tendency to block off those people who have disabilities since they believe there are only a small number of them, and because the world is still dominated by people who can hear, this does not have a significant impact on many things. These businesses simply concentrate on any kind of features they may add and hope to attract more customers who are hearing

One example of a private company that was brought up during our conversation is Twitter, whose management recently passed to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, an electric vehicle manufacturing company. The recent events, such as firing off those individuals who worked in Twitter when it had over 7,000 employees and now has only a few hundreds of employees, are highly regrettable and unacceptable. Elon Musk's actions had a significant impact on a variety of departments, most notably the accessibility engineering team, which had been laid off. This team was responsible for helping to make the website usable for people with disabilities, particularly those who struggle with sensory challenges, mobility issues, and visual or auditory impairment. It is a sign that Twitter may stop providing its users with access to the newest and most cutting-edge features in the future.

Therefore, one approach that may be taken is to consider how to persuade them or inform everyone else that the accessibility of websites and apps is a requirement that must be met in order to add features at all times. One potential obstacle is the amount of time. The corporation will need to carry out a number of different tests on the product and use the services of a few specialists. After that, the group will proceed to follow the evaluation to determine what issues are present with the product and make more tweaks and adjustments.

The fact that the company always has a restricted budget for the product means that it must eliminate elements that aren't really necessary in order to concentrate on the aspects that are essential. Another problem is the money. A potential option in which businesses might receive financial support from the government, allowing those businesses to implement and expand the majority of accessibility features.
