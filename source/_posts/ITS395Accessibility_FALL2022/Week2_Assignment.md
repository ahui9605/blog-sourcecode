- 2.1 Describe the history of WCAG
- 2.2 Identify any criticism of WCAG

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 were published in May 1999. WCAG 1.0 was a first step in defining criteria for web accessibility, focusing mostly on HTML. This iteration of the WCAG featured the compliance levels that we are still acquainted with today: A, AA, and AAA. Conformity to level A would entail complying with only level A success criteria, but conformance to level AAA would mean complying with every success criterion: A, AA, and AAA, making AAA the most thorough.

WCAG 2.0 was released over a decade later, in December 2008. WCAG 2.0 considered a wide range of technologies and advised developers to make all digital material accessible rather than just HTML-based content. In addition to accounting for a wider range of technologies, WCAG 2.0 developed four often referred to and used principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. These rules serve as categories for the WCAG success criteria; each success criterion tackles a barrier or barriers to making material visible, operable, comprehensible, and/or resilient for all users.

Another decade has passed, and WCAG 2.1 has been launched (June 2018). Instead of a major rewrite, as witnessed in the shift from 1.0 to 2.0, WCAG 2.1 adds success criteria to the existing 2.0 rules. This inclusion of new rules, rather than the rebuilding of existing rules, demonstrates the meticulous effort required to develop WCAG 2.0. Many of the new WCAG 2.1 criteria address accessibility restrictions that have become apparent as mobile web surfing has grown in popularity. Then, a working draft of WCAG 2.2 was just released in August 2020. The working draft WCAG 2.2, which is an extension of the existing standards, presently includes new success criteria and changes to one existing success criteria.

Because the technology we use is continually evolving, the criteria we use to analyze websites for accessibility must be updated to stay consistent. WCAG 2.1 and 2.2 cover weaknesses that have emerged since the introduction of WCAG 2.0 as the norm for online accessibility, but as we saw in the progression of WCAG from 1.0 to 2.0, a thorough rethink of these standards will eventually be required. To meet this requirement, a task group has been created to develop an altogether new set of online accessibility standards. The revised recommendations will be known as "W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0." The World Wide Web Consortium, abbreviated W3C, is "an worldwide community that produces open standards to assure the long-term evolution of the web". The inclusion of W3C in the official name is significant since it indicates that these criteria will eventually be applied to more than simply web content.

While the WCAG is improving with many updates and drafts, I must admit that it is a little complicated for me when designing a website or an application for end-users. The most essential aspect is that it is not mandatory; this may be one of the reasons why the WCAG is not widely used nowadays. If it is an act or a legislation that is carried out by the government or country, and it is mandatory and forced to have those accessible features and elements or you’ll get fine for not following the law. I am confident that it would be much greater than what we have now for providing various of accessibility to be able to use for many disabilities users.
