- 9.1 Identify the aspects of a screenreader (C?)
- 9.2 Evaluate a website using a screenreader (C?)

The primary objective of the screen reader is to deliver as many messages as possible to the user. This objective applies regardless of the user's ability level; typical users as well as those with disabilities are able to use the screen reader at any given time and in any given circumstance. And the vast majority of people who use the screen reader are either blind, low-vision, or both blind and low-vision users. It gives the feedback, and the information that is being read is being supplied under the control of the user.

The Text-to-Speech (TTS) function is one that may be used, and it can convert the information that is displayed on the screen into speech, which can be played through headphones or speakers. The TTS reader may take the form of a software program that is bundled together with the screen reader, or it may take the form of a hardware device that is plugged into the computer. It is also possible to offer information in Braille; however, in order to do so, an additional hardware device known as a refreshable Braille display is necessary, and this will necessitate the use of that device. There can be anywhere from one to several rows of cells in a refreshable Braille display. Each cell has the potential to take the form of a Braille character, which is made up of a succession of dots arranged in a pattern that is analogous to that of domino dots.

The Braille characters on the display will update to reflect the new information as it appears on the computer screen. This will provide users with up-to-date information that comes directly from the computer. While it is feasible to use each format on its own, most people prefer to use PDFs. Speech output and braille output are two forms of output that are frequently used together.

The popular operating systems, including those found on personal computers and mobile phones, are compatible with screen readers:

- Windows: Window Eyes
- Apple(iOS and MacOS): Voice Over
- Android: TalkBack

These are the applications that come pre-installed on the computer and can be used by the user without the need to install anything else. The user may also use third-party software such as Jaws for Windows, but this is entirely up to their discretion.

I'm going to test out a website called Google Drive by using the screen reader that comes installed on my iPhone, which is called VoiceOver. Once I'm logged in, I'll use the screen reader to go through some folders and files. After spending around half an hour to studying and familiarizing myself with VoiceOver and its various features, I have the following results:

- I was able to successfully log in to my Google Drive account, which required me to enter my email address and password. This step took me around five minutes, during which time I had to type each letter or number individually. Which is not very comfortable for me to use, and it is highly ineffective, but I believe that users with low eyesight or no vision at all require this.
- After I have logged into my Google Drive account, the user interface can be confusing at times because I tend to read from the top left to the bottom right. However, the design of the interface is intended for users with normal vision, which makes it difficult for blind users to use. Additionally, the interface contains a lot of complicated information, which blind users are unable to remember in a short amount of time, which requires them to go back and read it again.
