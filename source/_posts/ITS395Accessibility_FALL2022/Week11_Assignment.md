- 11.1 Identify various types of accessibility law (C?)
- 11.2 Analyze how accessibility laws are interpreted (C?)

### Americans with Disabilities Act(ADA)

In employment, state and local government, public accommodations, commercial facilities, transportation, and telecommunications, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) makes it illegal to discriminate against disabled people based on their condition. It is also applicable to the Congress of the United States.
To be eligible for protection under the ADA, a person must either themselves have a disability or maintain a relationship or association with another person who does. According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a person is considered to have a disability if they either have a physical or mental impairment that significantly inhibits one or more of the major life activities, if they have a history or record of having such an impairment, or if they are perceived by other people to have such an impairment. However, The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not identify each and every impairment that it protects.

### Telecommunication Act

Manufacturers of telecommunications equipment and providers of telecommunications services are required, according to Section 255 and Section 251(a)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, to ensure that such equipment and services are accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, if it is readily achievable to do so. These provisions were added to the Communications Act in 1996. Because of these amendments, people who have disabilities will be able to access a wide variety of products and services, such as telephones, cell phones, pagers, call-waiting, and operator services, which were previously inaccessible to a large number of users with disabilities.

### Rehabilitation Act; Section 508

The requirements that are outlined in Section 508 apply to any and all forms of electronic and information technology that are created, maintained, purchased, or used by the federal government. People with disabilities, including federal employees and members of the general public, are required to have access to all electronic and information technology used by the federal government in accordance with Section 508.
An accessible information technology system is one that does not rely on the user's singular sense or ability in any way and can be operated in a variety of different ways by the user. For instance, people who have visual impairments may not be able to use a system that only provides output in the form of images, and people who are deaf or hard of hearing may not be able to use a system that only provides output in the form of sounds if the system only provides output in the form of sounds. It's possible that some people with disabilities will require accessibility-related software or peripheral devices in order to use computer systems that are in compliance with Section 508.

Since each state is responsible for the enforcement of its own laws, it would appear that the federal laws do not apply to the states. It is possible that some of the accessibility measures taken by states are inadequate, and as a result, they are inaccessible.
And vice versa, certain states had very detailed information that explained which part of the disabilities should be applicable in a variety of different possible situations. One such example is the law 18VAC135-50-200 of the state of Virginia. Prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of disability at the general level. It provided an explanation of what the terms of the disabilities are as well as the
