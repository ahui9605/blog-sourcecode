- 8.1 Identify different methods of evaluating web accessibility (C?)
- 8.2 Identify the components of a formal web evaluation report (C?)

There are various methods that may be used to evaluate the accessibility of the website; however, the most frequent method is for me to experiment on my own and utilize the information that I have acquired up to this point to test the website to determine if it is accessible enough for me. But it does not effective enough. Because there is a huge amount of accessibility that needs to be tested, and because working on it necessitates a significant amount of time. So that we may use the tool, an excellent example of which is a tool called AXE accessibility DevTools. This tool is based on the WCAG, and it can assist us in determining which component of the website is not accessible. A programmable plugin like this one can be installed in the browser. Given that it is intended for the developer, they will need to manually enable it after going into the web developer page and doing so. Only then will the accessibility be checked. It is a really simple procedure, and all you need is a little bit of time to become acquainted with the information that they include.

It had helped a lot of institutions achieve the digital accessibility goals, such as retailers, airlines, hotel chains, and the government. It is free to use for the individual, but with limitation functions; therefore, it provides the Axe DevTools Pro and Enterprise version, which includes details about the accessibility with higher standards.

Following the completion of the website evaluation, we will need to provide a summary of what we discovered while analyzing the targeted website and explain the problem. A specialized report is born, and it is created by the specialist that is knowledgeable on accessibility, and they will analyze the websites that are the focus of their investigation and evaluate them. Find out some of the problems that exist, and then write a report about their experience using the internet, including an evaluation report, the criteria, a conclusion, and a recommendation.
After delivering the report to the developer, the accessibility specialist might be required to collaborate with the developer in order to determine what the most fundamental and fundamentally important accessibility standards are. This would come after the specialist had already given the developer the report. The professional will act as a consultant to advise them on how to make improvements to the website in question.
