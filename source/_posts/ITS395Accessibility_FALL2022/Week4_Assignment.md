- Describe vision-related challenges in web accessibility that users face.
- Identify web accessibility tools or approaches that benefit users with vision challenges.
- Analyze the effectiveness of WCAG 2.1 in measuring accessibility for blind users.

According to the statistics, around 285 million people worldwide are visually impaired. 39 million individuals are blind, while 246 million have impaired eyesight. There are numerous types of visually impaired individuals for whom it is important to provide easier online access or browsing. WCAG2.1 has introduced a requirement for individuals with low vision, describing what individuals with low vision require for electronic information, tools, and technology to be accessible. Includes an overview of low vision and a description of specific user requirements. Therefore, it is in excellent condition for blind users.

The WCAG2.1 specified multiple levels, including hardware, operating system, user agents, extensions, and plug-ins. They had to add as many things as possible to ensure that blind individuals could access everything. The following are concerns that I believe blind users are now having and that need to be resolved immediately:
HTML structure: the majority of famous websites now provide basic and advanced accessibility for people with disabilities. One feature that can be used is the screen reader, which can detect and read the CSS of a page, but this feature will need to be added and supported on third-party websites. Others relied on unstyled HTML, which causes problems when the screen reader determines what should be read first on a page. To overcome this problem, all HTML should be formatted similarly to a printed page, such that it makes sense when read from left to right, top to bottom. The routine update from the developer must include these changes for the screen reader to function properly.

The lack of color contrast between text and backgrounds is one of the most common accessibility issues. Color contrast is a fundamental component of online accessibility since it aids users in perceiving page information. WCAG 2 defines contrast as the difference in luminance between two colors. Persons with limited contrast sensitivity, such as the elderly, or colorblind people may not be able to distinguish between text and backdrop of specific colors with a low contrast ratio. Popular browsers include built-in functions that allow the user to force a certain hue to the desired intensity level.

People with visual impairments frequently find it difficult or impossible to use a mouse to surf a website; thus, they navigate using the keyboard. Those with visual impairments can navigate a website using keyboard shortcuts and commands. A website must have well-structured content with proper header structures and be coded to permit keyboard access to all information and functionality, including hyperlinks, links, forms, and media controls. Users would utilize the Tab key to navigate the page, and while they do so, there must be a visual keyboard focus indicator indicating the element they are on. Essential functions that must be provided on every website.

There are still a great number of potential approaches that could lead blind users to browse sites that are inaccessible or that do not provide sufficient accessibility. This has to be done with a large number of volunteers and experiments for blind people in order to make things more accessible for them.
