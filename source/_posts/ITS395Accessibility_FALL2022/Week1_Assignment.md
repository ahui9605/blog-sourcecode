Week 1 Assignment
Web accessibility (also known as Digital Accessibility or Web usability) aims to ensure that anyone has the means to access the media content placed on the Web - regardless of whether people experience physical, mental, or technical barriers that prevent the information posted by the author. This means making content on the Web "accessible" and easy to access and use. Whether it is the general public or people with physical or mental disabilities, they need to have a standardized website to access information easily. Web accessibility is to expand the standardization of the website and to design the website with a more rigorous attitude and conditions so that the content of the website can be "accessible" to users with different levels or needs.

Web pages created using the Web Accessibility Guidelines, such as WCAG standards and W3C Accessibility Standards, are useful for users with visual, auditory, mobility, and cognitive impairments. It is also useful for users of older, slower computers. In fact, an approachable design is not only helpful for those who have difficulties in their daily lives but also for all others who would benefit from a better interface. The advantages of web accessibility also include increasing the diversity of employment opportunities, shortening the digital gap, expanding social life, relieving psychological stress, etc.

A developer who designs the website needs to have enough knowledge to be able to comprehend various types of disabilities in order to determine which accessibility is best for disability users. This is one of the most important things that we need to work on. One significant accessibility is the numerous websites that people can access without any problem, including those with hearing or vision impairments or any other disability that affects physical structure or function; accessibility is a general term that includes any impairment or restriction in activities. There could be a number of factors that contributed to the disability, including a person's age, cognitive impairment from birth, various diseases, and accidents that affected the person with the disability. According to an article, the top 3 causes of disability are heart disease, back or spine issues, and arthritis or rheumatism. These are the ailments and diseases that affect us most frequently.

Many regions and governments have formed their disability standards available as a guide, listing nearly every type of disability that could possibly affect a person along with a thorough explanation of how to recognize it and the boundaries it places on them. Where people can offer accessible services to people with disabilities. As an example, the United States passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, which outlines the rights to which people with disabilities are entitled, including non-discrimination in employment. These laws/Acts also give them their rights to get what they should get. Additionally, the amendment clarifies what phrases like "major life act" and "substantial limitations" mean.

In conclusion, the primary objective of accessibility is to enable everyone to use the website, regardless of their language proficiency or type of disability. The website should be accessible to almost everyone. There are many different kinds of disabilities in the world and among us, so some may be difficult to identify while others may be obvious from a person's physical actions. To learn more, consult a reference list of the various disabilities is a necessary step.
