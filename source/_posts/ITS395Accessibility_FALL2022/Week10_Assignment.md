- 10.1 Describe the history of WAI-ARIA development (C?)
- 10.2 Implement a working WAI-ARIA (C?)

For digital accessibility, the screen reader technology includes a variety of different pieces of equipment, such as braille writers, scanning equipment, and other screen readers. I will browse the website using the keyboard and act as though I am blind so that I can use the screen reader to test the website's digital accessibility: web accessibility auditing showcase.
After installing and setting up the extension and the integrated function screen reader that comes with the Edge browser, and then I will use the keyboard to interact with the content that is displayed on the webpage. In addition to that, I had tried out a few of the things, such as the PDF and the image gallery. The Read aloud option of the Edge browser allows for text on the screen to be read out loud. Due to the fact that I am hard of hearing and use a cochlear implant, the speaking is not always very clear to me. As a result, I had to use the voice to text recognition apps on my phone in order to have a more positive experience when using the screen reader.
And I had try all of the content in the website:

- Left side menu: It is first not obvious to me since the left side menu is supposed to be the last part of the webpage, but it appears to give me the impression that the left side menu is the first portion of the webpage. However, I do not object to it and do not find it objectionable in any way.
- Carousel at the top of the content area of the page: It performs a good job of displaying the text and provides a concise explanation of each image, which allows me to imagine what the image would seem like to someone who is blind.
- Accordion on the right: excellent and user-friendly in directing me through each drop-down menu and allowing me to read the contents.
- Tab panel in the centre of the page: In the poor example, the tab does not make sense to me, whereas in the excellent example, it functions perfectly, and I have no trouble understanding any of the content.

Landmarks present on the page(list them): {% label h1 blue %} such as web accessibility auditing showcase, Home, {% label h2 blue %} like bad example, and good example and useful resources. The html code for each page contained headings labeled "h1," "h2," "h3," and so on. Because of this, whenever there is text on a page that does not particularly interest me, I can just skip the "h2" and "h3" headings and go straight to the "h1" heading for the next section of the page.

During this activity, I only spent ten minutes exploring the homepage of the web accessibility auditing showcase website. I spent an additional five minutes trying to learn and get the hang of using the screen reader with a number of different keyboard input functions; however, I am now able to use the screen reader to access the most fundamental input functions.

And I think it is a little bit inefficient for both me and also for blind people, because it seems impossible to let blind users see and know all of the content in a very short amount of time; it is a little bit inefficient for blind people. so I think people should work on improving that aspect of it. The screen reader application itself is quite useful, however more developers need to be made aware that ARIA compliance is essential for all websites.
