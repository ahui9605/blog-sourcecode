- 7.1 Describe the types of assistive technology (C?)
- 7.2 Describe the process of testing for accessibility (C?)

Assistive technology is a broad term that can refer to a variety of different things. For example, it can refer to mobility devices like walkers and wheelchairs that enable people with disabilities to be able to do something by using the mobility device. It can also refer to certain pieces of hardware and software that help people with disabilities access computers and other information technologies such as accessibility for website, the software had integrated functions that allow user to set up their accessible preference. In this week, we were discussed and concentrated on the assistive technology for reading pdf files and how it can be used and set up for those who require accessibility in order to read pdf information.

There are many different kinds of assistive technology that can be used on pdf file. One of the most common features is magnifiers, which enable the user to make the texts and images larger for those who have limited vision. Screen reading functions allow a computer to "speak out" for blind users by reading information and words one at a time. It may be difficult for some people to use all of the information contained within a PDF due to the complicated layouts that may be included in some PDFs. Therefore, the significance of content ordering is the primary worry, and it is necessary to add more tags and a number order in order to concentrate on a certain piece of content at one time only. It is required that images of alternative text also be included, and if it is necessary, the decorating images should be removed and there are many more functions that may be used, depending on what situation is needed.

The accessibility testing by an expert or anyone who had the capacity knowledge of accessibility is the necessary step that needs to be done in order to ensure that the fundamental functionalities will be available for use in pdf format.

These experts will be of assistance and will determine whether or not the PDF is accessible by the majority of users. This week in class, Our professor demonstrated how to utilize a piece of software called Adobe Acrobat DC. One of the built-in features that made it possible for the pdf editor to update and adjust the accessibility of the document. In addition to that, it had the capabilities to test the PDF to see if it met the requirements for basic usability.
