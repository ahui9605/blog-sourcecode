- Describe web accessibility challenges that deaf users face.
- Identify web accessibility tools and approaches that benefit deaf users.

To understand what challenges deaf people faced, we must first understand what deaf is and why they are deaf, how they need accessibility due to their deaf disability, and where we can apply those accessibility on deaf users in a proper situation, such as in person accessibility or virtual online accessibility.

Deaf is an adjective word used to describe someone who lacks the ability to hear or has impaired hearing, according to the dictionary. It is a physical condition in which the person is unable to collect information through their ears. Deafness can be caused by a variety of factors, including aging hearing loss, genetic factors when they were born, or a specific medicine that led them to become deaf. So, accessibility is to guide or provide an easy route for them to rapidly comprehend what they need and how people may help them.

Accessibility is not exclusively for the deaf; it is a subset of accessibility for deaf users; there are many more ways to assist persons with disabilities. So, this sort of accessibility sometimes necessitates a certain amount of money to develop into a perfect form for deaf users to acquire what information they want on specific situations. However, the information they get is still slower than that of hearing people since it takes more time, more equipment, more technology to obtain, whereas hearing people can simply communicate to one other. It is also critical to design the computer's interface with humans, which is the designer's primary focus to lead the deaf user to use the accessibility function on website. Some low quality audio, lack in interpretation for text, audio and video and limited customer support options such as telephone for contacting the bank agent to process order and more are all the fatal problem on deaf. Some poor design website do not have enough of budget to develop those functions caused the deaf user were unable to access.

The bulk of accessibility functions, as well as a highly popular tool, are captions, which enable the transcription or translation of spoken language in streaming or another live video. It is popular because it may nearly always apply to everyone: hearing, hard of hearing, and hearing loss. They can be beneficial to everyone. Hearing people may be able to read the captions if they hear something but are unsure what it is, or if they missed parts of the speaking. For those who are deaf or hard of hearing could be able to read the captions to understand what it is speaking.

Another popular feature is live chat, which is a tiny window on the left or right side of the website that allows consumers to contact agents without having to call them. This sort of feature is also very useful for deaf users. As a result, deaf users are more likely to use text-based communication as a secondary compromise technique, whereas ASL is more likely to be used as their first language. The plain English with short sentences is essential, as is staying on point and avoiding jargon or rarely used English work. If required, a graphic to illustrate the topic or anything is also a terrific idea that would aid deaf users greatly.

There are also more features that may be implemented, such as ASL video for visual interpretation; but, in order to give the proper message, a very skilled certificated interpreter is required. A transcript, which comes with a page or more of text with everything they've spoken on it, is also an option. These things must be adaptable and organize in order to navigate the information they get.
