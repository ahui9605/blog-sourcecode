### Research Topics and Questions

As a person who did not have any previous experience with mobile development, I am curious as to how I can combine the information that I have gained thus far with the knowledge that I will gain in the future in fall semester in order to incorporate the works into our project. At the same time, there needs to be a certain contribution made to speed up the project. Therefore, a predetermined portion of the available resources must be used as a point of reference for me to be able to continue with my progress, with the high standard of quality such as ease of use and accessibility on mobile application with as few roadblocks as is humanly possible.

### Two Journal articles:

<b>SHNEIDERMAN, B. E. N. (2007). We can design better user interfaces: A review of Human-Computer Interaction Styles. Taylor & Francis Online, 31(5). https://doi.org/10.1080/00140138808966713</b>

The author offers the following three pillars to help the user interface design process. The author encourages us to focus more attention and time on the HCI to direct manipulation in which the objects and actions are visible with three pillars: Documents serving as guidelines, a User Interface Management System, and usability laboratories for repeated testing are all essential. This article review can be used as a reference to provide us with some ideas about the kind of interface that we need to develop, so keep that in mind as we go through it. It is really helpful for me in terms of the development of mobile apps, which means that we may incorporate them into our project.

<b>Chin, J. P., Diehl, V. A., & Norman, L. K. (1988). Development of an instrument measuring user satisfaction of the human-computer interface. Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - CHI '88, CHI(Proceedings). https://doi.org/10.1145/57167.57203</b>

Experiments of both a quantitative and qualitative nature are being conducted in this article, with participants coming in to evaluate various aspects of the interface. After completing the series of tasks, a questionnaire will be presented for the interface satisfying of using the application. The researcher will provide the data graphs to demonstrate that the interface is easy to use or not. When we are still in the preliminary stages of developing our mobile app, using this methodology to collect information on the ease of use should prove to be highly beneficial to our project.

### One book chapter

<b>Roth, R. M., Dennis, A., Wixom, B. H., Wixom, B. H., & Wixom, B. H. (2013). User Interface Design Process, Interface Structure Design. In Systems analysis and design (pp. 325–327). essay, John Wiley. </b>

ISD (Interface Structure Diagram) are used to demonstrate how all of the screens, forms, and reports that are used by the system are related to one another as well as how the user navigates from one to the next. The majority of systems consist of multiple ISDs, one for each significant component of the system. Lines connecting each interface to its neighboring interfaces demonstrate to users how they can go from one screen to the next in the hierarchy of interfaces. The visualized diagram may be of use to the developer in the process of developing the project idea. It should be a great way for me to use while working on this group project. It provided an explanation of how to use the design and how to ensure that the correct messages and design were delivered to OB. This can be allowed OB to understand what my thoughts were and also allow him/other group members to use my design diagram to adjust and fix by their ideas.

### A collection of some review articles related to HCI

<b>Punchoojit, L., & Hongwarittorrn, N. (2017, November 9). Usability studies on Mobile User Interface Design Patterns: A Systematic Literature Review. Advances in Human-Computer Interaction. Retrieved October 30, 2022, from https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ahci/2017/6787504/ </b>

The author is of the opinion that there are no standards for creating a consistent user interface for mobile applications; consequently, he conducted a systematic literature review of the design of mobile user interfaces before gathering additional details and getting ready to conduct their research. It offered more than a hundred different reviews of articles and let me read any of them along with a brief summary of the author's thoughts on the work. To look for what materials I need to locate from this article review is something that has shown to be quite helpful for me.

### Resources taken from the notes

<b>Rae, M. (2020, July 27). Mobile design with Adobe XD. Adobe.com. Retrieved October 27, 2022, from https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/learn/design/layout/adobe-xd-for-mobile-design.html </b>

For first-time developers, instructions and guidelines for creating the user interface (UI) by utilizing Adobe Xd, along with transition graphics and text-based explanations, are provided. It can learn how to make a UI with just a few basic functions, the interaction buttons can be utilized, etc., which can speed up the learning of Adobe Xd. It is similar to a brief tutorial, but it has been formatted into an "article-like" tutorial. Therefore, with this kind of tutorial, I may become familiar with the components that comprise immersive experiences. Which is a terrific point for someone who is just starting off like me.

<b>Smith, A. (2021, June 30). Adobe XD vs sketch — a comparison about the good the bad the more fitting. uxplanet.org. Retrieved October 30, 2022, from https://uxplanet.org/adobe-xd-vs-sketch-a-comparison-about-the-good-the-bad-the-more-fitting-451fb155e2 </b>

Examine two programs, Adobe Xd and Sketch, and provide input on the benefits and drawbacks of employing each in the capacity of a moderately experienced developer. Along with this, include some comments for those who are just starting out. The author presented a number of the one-of-a-kind functions that can only be employed by each software itself, and he or she indicated whether or not they are worth learning and putting into practice. It may be a fantastic start for me to pick which program to use to make the UI design that is best for me. I will take both the benefits and negatives to compare, and I will also check to see whether OB is in agreement with me regarding these functions.

<b>jtenenbg. (2018). Shneiderman's "Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design". Washington Education. Retrieved October 30, 2022, from https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/almstrum/cs370/elvisino/rules.html </b>

The more concise and easy-to-understand rules that enable developers to rapidly comprehend the necessary features that need to be added or adjusted without having to read a great deal of text and information, and it had been extensively used all over the world. In order for the other members of the group to be able to help us with some basic evaluation and provide some feedback on our mobile app design, we ask them to first understand what interface design is and then show them this paper as an excellent way of how to do so without requiring them to spend a significant amount of time.

### Professional websites and possible resources

<b>Yoo, H., & Lee, Y. (2017). An Automatic Mobile App Testing Method with User Event Scenario. CSDL | IEEE Computer Society. Retrieved October 31, 2022, from https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/mdm/2017/07962487/12OmNB1NVNv </b>

According to the author, the tool that was utilized by the team and referred to as "Monkey" is a fundamental instrument that can test and forecast the user behaviors, reactions, and actions of interacting with the Mobile app in a variety of scenarios, but Monkey does not have enough of the ability for testing complex situation. So the author developed an innovative strategy that is capable of being implemented with greater efficiency and a more rapid pace of testing. Despite the fact that it is test on Android devices, the concept may be used on our mobile application development to gauge the response of the participants.

<b>Ruderman, R. (2022, February 17). Teach Access Tutorial. Access Computing. Retrieved October 31, 2022, from https://teachaccess.github.io/tutorial/ </b>

It is a professional website that guides developers and users to interact with the accessibility on web and mobile applications. This website has clear instructions for using which kind of software is the best suit for uses, and it also maintains the design principles. This can be used as a guideline on the accessibility on video, the text for users who are deaf or blind. Nevertheless, I believe that it will be of some assistance to me, and I intend to make use of it as a reference while I collaborate with another member of my group, OB, to design a mobile application that is more accessible to disabilities people.

<b>Savory, A. (2014, October 1). Develop hybrid mobile applications with Apache Cordova and PhoneGap Enterprise with Andrew Savory. Association for Computing Machinery. Retrieved October 31, 2022, from https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/mobile </b>

The Association for Computer Machinery (ACM) is the largest computing society in the world, and its extensive learning center and special content can be of great assistance to students like myself. This article, which provides brief summary of creating a hybrid application by making use of Apache Cordova, is an excellent illustration of how to get started with mobile app development. I won't get into these much more in-depth topics, but I do plan to spend about half an hour watching the presentation and figuring out what the point of creating the hybrid mobile app application is and how I can apply it to our work.
