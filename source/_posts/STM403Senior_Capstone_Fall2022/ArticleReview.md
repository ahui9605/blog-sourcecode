description: Article Review of a Comparison of Comprehension Processes in Sign Language Interpreter Videos with or without Captions
---

The article focused on the captions and sign language video to see if the video with both captions and a sign language interpreter is better than the video with just the interpreter. The author is trying to conduct some very simple experiments with participants who are hard of hearing and deaf, and then analyze the results to determine which method of demonstrating accessibility is preferable for those who are hard of hearing and deaf. The researched is experiment and evaluate in Europe with German and Slovenian participants. And their language used are in Slovene language

According to the article, two different groups—one for hard of hearing participants and another for deaf participants—were separated to prevent any discrepancies data during the research methodology. Before beginning the experiment, a survey and examination need to be conducted to ensure that everyone is fully informed. There are four sections to the experiment or methods: introduction, training/practice, experiments, and evaluation:

<b>Introduction:</b> Some of the participants for the tests were managed to pick and when they arrive at the research room, an introduction to the test is obligated, including a consent form and information sheet for participants. The participants must also complete their profile, including information about their age and gender (there are no restrictions for the experiment), and their proficiency with sign language and closed captions, their vision status (so they can watch videos without any issues), and their knowledge of basic Slovenian language.

<b>Training/Practicing:</b> The researcher showed a short warming-up video after participants signed the consent form and indicated they were ready to continue. It serves as a learning tool for the experiments. Two videos, one in sign language with captions and the other without, will need to be watched for about ten minutes. After watching a video, participants will be asked to respond to a few questions.

<b>Experiments:</b> After that, proceed to the experimental session where four videos with conversation from daily life will be shown. Each video, whether it has captions or not, includes ten follow-up questions.

<b>Evaluation:</b> Participants will be asked to rate their experience watching videos with or without captions on a scale of 1 to 10, and the researcher will note their rating score and their comments for analysis purpose.

The technical equipment they used appear to have gone unmentioned in the article, but what is pretty clearly seen in figure 2 of the informational block and hiking video questionnaire, in the Background and Literature Review, is displayed by the Internet Explorer browser. A simple and direct video with open-captions: burned in captions that cannot be drag, interact or change font color and size like Youtube’s closed-captions, and a sign language interpreter is displayed on the screen. Additionally, there is an arrow button that can be likely to move the next video or questionnaire of the video.

The median number is mathematically much more accurate than the mean (average number), so in this article for the research purpose, used the median number to analyze the results while the standard deviation provides the precise interpretation of participant's score with a distribution. The data were collected from participants 1 to 10 score survey. The data was determined using a mathematical formula in the article, and the results were shown with two findings. One finding is that the average understanding of video content by hard of hearing participants, both with open-captions and sign interpreter only, is higher than deaf participants. The second finding indicated that, among deaf and hard-of-hearing participants, the four videos with open captions collectively scored higher than the video without captions.

According to the article's conclusion, 24% more deaf people can understand videos when there are captions and sign interpreters present. To 42% for those who have hearing impairments.

Personally, I agree with the experiment's findings, and I recognize that other articles reporting on similar research also managed to reach the same findings. The article is concise and clear, and the majority of the text is written in plain English, which makes it easy for a non-native English speaker like me to read. The specifics of English writing, as well as the conclusion and outcomes they appear to suggest, are perfectly understandable.

After reading this article, I found it very helpful in developing the mobile app for my group project. It also answers one of my questions related to the exercise details, specifically whether the video example shown to the user is needed to provide a sign language interpreter alone or includes captions with sign interpreters. So, it's apparent that we need both of them to ensure that our users have a higher understanding of what we're attempting to communicate to them while also increasing accessibility for disabilities.
