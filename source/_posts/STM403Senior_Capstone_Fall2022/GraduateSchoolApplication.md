Dear xxx,

I'm excited to apply for the intern technician position posted on Indeed.com as a semester term intern of the work done by the team at REU AICT. As a BS in Information Technology student at Gallaudet University, I'm confident that my diverse knowledge, experience in coding and problem solving, and meticulous attention to detail will make me an asset to the intern and class/personal project teamwork.

I assisted several more students in classes and on social media platforms such as StackoverFlow and Github. I was in charge of troubleshooting a wide range of technical issues for others, assisting with unexpected system errors, and installing a wide range of equipment. I was also constantly looking for new ways to learn new skills and gain experience by participating in various activities with people from all walks of life. With these kinds of experiences, I was able to adapt my approach to various problems and situations from various backgrounds, as well as their critical-thinking and ideas that differed from mine.

I also understand that [Company name] is looking for more interns and experienced employees to help with their production needs. The position of IT technician at [Company's name] would be an exciting opportunity for me to apply my educational background and learn more about a growing industry.

I've attached my resume, which goes over my skills and educational background in greater detail. If you have any questions about my background and experiences, don’t be hesitate to contact me. Thank you very much for your consideration and time.

Sincerely.
Zehui Liu
