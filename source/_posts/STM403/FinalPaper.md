---

To the STM403 Managers:
We are delighted that our project was chosen, and we are honored to have the chance to discuss the concept of our initiative here. It is evident that you are looking for an enthusiastic group team that can be depended upon to completely engage with the role and develop professionally in a self-motivated manner. We are excited to bring this project to a close since it has the potential to have a tremendous influence not only on the Gallaudet University campus but also on the campuses of other universities.

This initiative was conceived to enhance and motivate students, as well as bring them into a brighter future in terms of their education in general and their physical education in particular. We understand our student urgently needs a solution for an application. That’s why our STM group is attempting to develop and improve a comprehensive approach to app development that takes guessing out of the game. We’re ecstatic that you're considering working as a partner with us. The following proposition will outline a strategy for proceeding with the project from the beginning to the conclusion. We are confident that we will completely understand the process and the anticipated amount of time needed to complete the task. I am sure you will acknowledge the information we gave and the high quality of the standards.
If you have any questions regarding our project you’d like to discuss, we would be more than happy to meet with you for clarification.
Sincerely,
Abraham, Charles, Obaidullah, and Zehui

### Abstract

Numerous studies reveal a marked drop in physical activity participation and increased sedentary behavior among young adults during the college years (Calestine et al.,.2017). Due to a lack of fitness, health education, and workout equipment, more than half of university students in the United States do not engage in enough physical activity to improve their health, despite being motivated to lose weight or gain muscle (Wharton et al., 2008). Therefore, the appropriate interventions and guidelines are needed to measure and support student’s physical activity. Our project aims to promote quality fitness for our Gallaudet University students. We set aside some time to investigate the drawbacks of Gallaudet fitness and determine the areas that could most benefit from improvement. We used the ACSM (The American College of Sports Medicine) as the reference to coming up with an early development mobile app that allows our users to use the guideline with a simplified approach effectively. This project aims to understand our users' opinions about fitness in university physical fitness centers and mobile fitness apps. We tried to collect some feedback on the performance of our newly developed fitness application in terms of several variables, including interface designs, workout instructions, ease of use, and accessibility. A group of participants will be given access to our application. We collect feedback from them to see if our application design is practical and capable from their point of view. We anticipate getting additional findings, at which point we can continue providing analysis, whether critical or complimentary, on many fitness-related subjects. It is possible that we will not be able to offer the final results due to unforeseen reasons, including the delay of the IRB approval. But what can be seen is that there are numerous trending and well-liked fitness applications, particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic (Cugusi et al., 2021), so we expected the mobile fitness app that including ACSM guidelines for fitness instruction, which would be advantageous to all users and worthy of continued development by future handovers.

### Introduction

_Background:_
Daily physical activity, including mobile phone apps related to physical activity and exercise, provides various health benefits and is one of the recommendations for addressing lifestyle-related diseases in the United States (Guo et al., 2022). Regular physical activity can reduce the risk of many diseases and even death. It can also lower the risk of mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, or other mental diseases. With the speedy development of mobile technologies, mobile apps related to physical activity have a great potential to improve participation rates in exercise programs (Gowin et al., 2015, Grave, 2020).
Exercise guidelines are set forth by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). ACSM recommends that the frequency, intensity, time, and type (FITT) principle be followed for any exercise program to have health benefits and avoid injuries (Thompson, 2013, Guo et al., 2022). The ACSM principles of exercise prescription recommend three main components. These principal components are aerobic exercise, strength and resistance, and flexibility. These components play a significant role in improving health. In fact, no apps scored inadequately against the ACSM exercise prescription guidelines (Guo et al., 2022).
Furthermore, nutrients also play a substantial role in mental and physical health. Some studies showed that diet and nutrition are essential for physiology and body composition. Not only that, but they also significantly affect mood and mental well-being (Muscaritoli, 2021). According to the National Institute of Health, several data have found a relationship between nutrition, physical fitness, and mental health. Nutrients and physical activity are the agents for prevention, treatment, or augmentation of treatment for mental disorders in children, adolescents, and adults (Grave, 2020, Muscaritoli, 2021).

_Mobile Application Background:_
A program that carries out specific tasks is an application or app. It is now an essential component of our life. Apps can be accessed on various mobile computing platforms, making using and accessing them simple. The apps were initially intended to be used for mail, contacts, calendars, etc., but due to increased public demand, they were expanded to include mobile games, GPS services, recharge, and ticket booking options, and fitness services, resulting in millions of apps that are now available on different application distribution platforms. (Hoon et al,. 2013). Apps can assist with setting fitness objectives, offering exercise suggestions, monitoring calorie intake, offering workout recipes, and offering progress graphs. Using the data one provides, apps also offer tailored advice. Numerous factors, including increased privacy, accessibility, time constraints, and lower costs compared to fitness centers, have contributed to the growth of app usage (Tong, H.L. et al. 2022).
An application can improve accessibility for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Many mobile apps rely on audio instructions and communication, which can be difficult for deaf individuals to access and understand. By incorporating ASL interpreters, a mobile app can provide visual, rather than auditory, instructions and communication, making it much more accessible and user-friendly for deaf individuals. Another benefit of a mobile app with ASL interpreters is that it can help to promote inclusivity and accessibility in various industries and situations. Deaf individuals may often feel excluded or disadvantaged when accessing information and services due to the reliance on auditory communication. The data shows that the ASL interpreters scored 3.72 out of 5, which is the second-highest accessibility use in mobile health (mHealth) apps (Romero\* et al., 2019). By providing ASL interpreters, a mobile app can help break down these barriers by providing ASL interpreters and making information and services more inclusive for deaf individuals.

### Issues

There is no current app for Gallaudet athletes and non-athlete students to access ASL information related to activity, training, and nutrition. There is no platform for visual workout lesson plans with ASL accessible where coaches can create their plans and assign the team to follow the process. Non-athlete students have limited access to the Gallaudet fitness center due to a lack of hours. They have less knowledge of fitness and nutrition due to a lack of a fitness coach or guide leader on how to exercise and food properly. We want to ensure that Gallaudet Community has access to fitness and nutrition information to reduce physical and mental health risks.

### Approach

In today's busy world, many people struggle to find the time and motivation to maintain a regular fitness routine. A mobile fitness app can provide users with a convenient way to track their progress and see their improvements over time. The app can also provide reminders and notifications to help users stay on track with their fitness goals. A fitness app can also provide users with a wide range of fitness-related information and resources. This can include exercise demonstrations, workout plans, nutrition guides, and other helpful tools. By providing users with all of the information and resources they need to achieve their fitness goals, a fitness app can be a valuable tool for improving overall health and wellness (Gowin et al., 2014). Another important purpose of a mobile fitness app is to help users connect with others who have similar fitness goals. One research shows that sharing workout progress and data with others can be an excellent motivator for many people to continue exercising where it provides a sense of accountability (Ehrlén, 2020). Many apps include features that allow users to share their progress and motivate each other, creating a sense of community and support. This can be especially helpful for individuals who are new to fitness or who may be struggling to stay motivated. Overall, there will be many benefits, and the mobile fitness app can provide individuals with a convenient and accessible way to track and improve their physical fitness. These apps can help users achieve their fitness goals and improve their overall health and wellness by offering a wide range of features and resources.

### Objectives/Main Goals

- To understand the reason why Gallaudet fitness is lacking services such as coaches and equipment
- To understand whether fitness applications are preferred over fitness centers
- To understand user perspectives about fitness apps
- To understand the popularity of fitness apps among users

### Method

_Survey Setup:_
We plan to set up a questionnaire survey at the early testing stage to collect data. To obtain valuable high-level responses and in-depth insights via an interview with each participant at the end of the testing stage will be conducted. This step is to get additional clarification information, answer participants’ confusing questions, and receive feedback on our project idea. Participants will rank each question from 1 to 5 based on how much they agree with the statement they are reading. There are English and ASL versions available for use. The surveys are done through Google form. Due to waiting for IRB approval, we decided to discuss what features and tools will be included in the app design.

_Mobile Application Setup:_
To help users understand what they should do about fitness, we integrated our ACSM guidelines into the mobile app. The interface, created with Adobe XD, included information on the workouts, exercises, and dietary intake. Since our applications are still in the early stages of development, only the volunteer participants were permitted to test the app. Fitness apps come in a few main functions to serve the user's diverse needs:

- Workout Plan - provide users with a goal plan such as a fit body plan, lose weight plan, etc. To help users reach their goals.
- Activity Tracker — Uses mobile sensors to track a person’s daily motions, such as walking, jogging, and running, and then analyzes them for the user.
- Personal Trainer- helping those who do not want to attend fitness classes and those with busy work schedules. The app acts as a fitness coach and lets users create their trains.
- Diet and Nutrition- offering the options best suited to those seeking a balanced diet and who are health-conscious.
- Stretch/workout daily information - helping users to understand what benefits for their physical or mental from stretch/workout

_MobileApplication Concept/Design:_
We have three main structures (Figure 1) to make up our application: Home, Plans, and Daily. Each section has features, such as the home section's recommendation of a workout plan to attract users; the General section is the shortcut for quick start exercise, monitoring activity, and checking gym schedule. It has the personalized workout plan or the suggested plan we offered in the Plans section. The information about meal suggestions and nutrition has been gathered for the Daily section. Additionally, it has an activity tracker that measures the user's heart rate while exercising and the number of steps you take while running or walking. not just that only, but it also has a nutrient activity tracker with accurate information. This process is the same concept as dietary analysis with MyFitnessPal that has very accurate information with nutrient activity tracker. (Evenepoe et al., 2020).

![](/images/stm403,figure1.PNG "Figure 1: The Flowchart Showing the Mobile Application Structure")

When a user clicks on the exercise video before beginning, the application provides the prerequisites and instructions outlined by ACSM, which are also shown in the exercise video. When describing what should be done and what should not be done, as well as what can be expected after continuing to work out the plan after a week or a month, it must be very specific. These videos embed the various exercises with sign language instructions, and multiple languages are supported, and the workout will begin when the user clicks the play button. Once started, The user can highly customize how their preferred coach is set up, the video size, color background, etc.

![](/images/stm403,figure2.png "Figure 2: The Diagram of Our Draft Mobile Fitness Application Designed for Sign Up")

Our IT member simply marked, added, and edited each interface and interaction. This is not a programmed functionality application that involves any programming language. We use Adobe XD, a prototyping tool, to make the user interface, transitions, and interactive buttons with less cost and time.  
Since the Bison is the proprietary logo of Gallaudet University, we decided to call the app: Bison Fitness once we get the permission to use it. Figure 2 shows a number of ways users can sign up or log in to confirm so we can validate that the user who is attempting to log in is a Gallaudet University student. The user will then be prompted to enter information such as the body emphasis region of emphasis for the exercise, the primary goal of doing this, and which body part they want to gain and grow muscle on.

Figure 3 shows more interactive options for users, including videos and replays to build muscle or whatever they need. Users can choose a workout method. After the user selects a workout plan, it will show what they need to prepare, such as a yoga mat, dumbbells, a healthy diet, water, or other equipment, before starting. The exercise video and timer will follow. The viewer can pause, skip, and stop the video and request more counts. Rest, then return to the main website to start the next workout level.

We provide athletes teams with the app in Figure 3, the fifth diagram of the workout lesson can be found by the coach with his set. This app is useful for all Gallaudet athletes teams to track their workout plan/ lesson with the video guideline instructions, including ASL, pictures, etc. These would help them to avoid any injury. When the team was assigned to do a workout lesson created by the coach, they could start the workout by following the instruction. They can’t pretend to finish it by hand. Its app would display the workout video with the time based on the settings made by coaches. The team has to finish their workout lesson before the time out, so it will go on the completed list. Coaches can see whether they are finished or not.

### Mobile Application Evaluation

The evaluation was set in a few parts (Figure 4). The introduction to the evaluation and training mobile application was set at the beginning. Then came the actual main evaluation session and, finally, the Q&A session. Each participant was notified that there is no compensation for their time during the survey because we do not get support from organizations and departments. All of the things are volunteered. The feedback and survey remained confidential and was only to be shared among group members of this project.

![](/images/stm403,figure4.PNG "Figure 4: A Flowchart Showing The Process of the Evaluation")

1. First, we meet the participants and explain the Informed Consent and Feedback Release form in ASL or spoken English. A general explanation of the project's purpose was to be shared as follows: “In our STM Project, we are conducting studies of different people’s user experience and feedback on Gallaudet fitness center to promote accessibility for the on-campus/off-campus students and Gallaudet community.”
2. The participants will be seated in a room and can use electronic devices (smartphone/laptop) provided by our STM project group or bring their own devices to use.
3. The group member will explain the process of how to perform the application on a computer and mobile phone during the evaluation by showing the participants how to use and interact with them. Additionally, participants will expect to complete a Google Form survey and a short interview Q&A within a few minutes.
4. The expected time to be completed will be around 10 minutes to finish all the steps in this evaluation. If the participant is interested in the apps, we can provide them with the IPA IOS file to be installed on their phone. They can continue using our app for a week and return later for more feedback.

### Results

Since this research involved the human subject and collecting data from their feedback, and despite the fact that we still needed to be granted approval from the IRB, we had both the finished prerequisite survey and the process for conducting the evaluation ready to be implemented. Although we did not get the IRB approval, excluding the data we have yet to collect from participants, we did come across a lot of research from various sources. We discovered that the lack of on-campus exercise options at Gallaudet University, such as the limited schedule time (Gallaudet Athletics Weight Room 2022) and low, convenient commute between the fitness center and dorm, has resulted in a decrease in the number of people working out and has created an environment that discourages people from working out. Another result we discussed in our group was a member as a soccer player at Gallaudet University with other athletic teams: Charles experienced that the given workout plan and lessons provided by the coach were written on the whiteboard, which was ineffective for working out individually and with other athletic members. We also discovered that having a mobile device with a fitness app can significantly motivate and will gradually improve students' mental and physical health (Wharton et al,. 2008), but the majority of apps don't use exercises according to ACSM guidelines, which is likely to have an impact on the user's health and results in inefficient workouts of low quality (Guo et al., 2022).

We have created the preliminary design via Adobe XD for the mobile application. Figure 5 shows the login page to verify the user's identity and the home page, along with all of its essential features. Please note that this is not the final stage; further development with fresh concepts and features is worthwhile. The majority of the problems we currently have been solved by the mobile app.. It also complies with the prevalent use of fitness apps in the deaf community and increases the effectiveness of exercise with ACSM guidelines.

Our application prototype is finished and available for full interaction. This link [(Click here)](https://xd.adobe.com/view/2f363568-09f5-4109-b326-a4765c4e20fc-7a65/) will take you to a demonstration of the application. When the Adobe XD prototype is opened, the viewer can use a mouse or trackpad to interact with the application's buttons, much like on a real smartphone. Suppose the prototype receives clicks on areas that are not intended for clicking. In that case, blue boxes will appear on those that provide instructions to the viewer if they need clarification about how to interact with the prototype.

### Discussion/Conclusion

In conclusion, the use of a fitness mobile application with ACSM guidelines and regular exercise with detailed instructions and video tutorials, combined with the support of a sign language interpreter, can bring numerous benefits to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Exercise can improve physical health by increasing cardiovascular endurance, strengthening muscles, and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Additionally, regular exercise has been shown to improve mental health by reducing stress and anxiety, improving mood, and increasing self-esteem. A mobile fitness application, when used with the support of a sign language interpreter, can provide deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals with access to important health and fitness information, allowing them to track and monitor their physical activity, including different workout plans that can be set by an athletics coach or by the individual, and receive personalized workout recommendations. Overall, using a fitness mobile application and regular exercise, with the support of a sign language interpreter, can improve physical and mental health for deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals, making it an important aspect of their overall well-being.

### Future Work

A further step in the evaluation and analysis of the data is needed, even if we get approval from the IRB approval which only covered a small portion of the data we had collected. So a survey with more varied questions with more participants is necessary to collect more details about fitness.

We encourage participants and other volunteer individuals who are fluent in ASL or another sign language to create instructional workout videos that we can later embed their video in our mobile app to make the app more diverse and support more sign language in the deaf community. We will also develop and implement the goal we set for ourselves, which includes incorporating the ACSM guideline, information on physical activity and nutrition, and the possibility of adding new ideas in the future.

We strongly encourage anyone interested and the Gallaudet student life skill department in our project during the spring semester of 2023, when it will be carried out in conjunction with the IT Senior Capstone course. Our members who majored in IT will develop the programmed mobile application with Swift, which will require a significant amount of fitness data and references.

### Roles

Abraham Cervantes: I will support and assist any group members who need it. Prepare the tool that will be used to collect data on the arriving participants, such as using Google Sheet to produce graphs or tools to build tables. On the mobile application, create a data diagram, chart, and graphic concept that contains statistical information for the user. It visually balances time and speed in terms of kilometers traveled. My experience at Gallaudet University improved, and I was able to provide for Bison Fitness by contributing to our project group.

Charles Harris: My duties included researching American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for physical activities and mental well-being and making some examples of ACSM guidelines in the presentation. Gathered more information from good sources with peer-reviewed on how to exercise app beneficial to physical health and mental health. Created the questionnaire survey about 24/7 fitness, our mobile app, then made visionary data (Unfortunately, we have yet to hear from IRB for approval that we could not get data). I also made a presentation with design and helped some with the final paper.

Zehui Liu: It is my responsibility to come up with the idea for the mobile app as well as any new concepts, draw them all into some flowcharts to make them more visualized, and then hand them over to Obaidullah so that he can design the application. In addition to this, it is my responsibility to work on and revise the draft of the project proposal as well as write the final paper.

Obaidullah Bakali: In this project, as I am majoring in Information Technology, I am responsible for the technological aspect. I also am responsible for scheduling in-person or Zoom meetings to ensure that we all work together on the same page. I researched and reviewed several mobile designs for this project to improve the UI design. Since I have the Adobe XD prototype on my laptop, I am mainly focused on designing the mobile app and getting input from the three members of my group. In the project pitch, I helped organize concepts to include. In this proposal, I typed the issues section while we were discussing it in the group meeting and added some to the methods and results section.
