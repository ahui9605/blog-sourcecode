### Introduction

Gallaudet University is a private Federally Chartered University

- Established in 1857 with only twelve students
- Emphasizes diversity among staff and students, including international students.

Diversity has significantly increased at Gallaudet University over the years, with over 1,500 students pursuing degrees in various disciplines.

Our group were interested in learning more about Gallaudet Graduates regarding their home location and degrees obtained from Gallaudet University.

- Data were obtained from Gallaudet University Institutional Research.
- Allowed us to dig deeper into the data uncovering some interesting facts about Gallaudet’s graduates.
- This is a preliminary short-term research project for the course, and does not represent any official university research projects.

The maps were created using ESRI ArcGIS Pro mapping software, which also allowed data visualization to highlight facts about Gallaudet graduates

Our data, spanning back to 2000 to 2022, is focused on the following:

- Home state (or country if applicable) of Gallaudet Graduates.
- Population density of Gallaudet Students.
- Showcasing the map of U.S. in regard to Deaf schools (Daytime & Resident-based schools).
- Data for international students’ home schools were not available.
- Highlighting the difference between Females and Males Graduates obtaining a degree from Gallaudet University on the global map.
- Showcasing countries on a global scale in regard to type of degree obtained at Gallaudet University.

### Conclusion

Preliminary and proof-of-concept data analysis indicates that student diversity at Gallaudet University is healthy and possibly expanding.
Student population density is more pronounced and visible on the East Coast compared to West Coast, likely due to:

- Smaller state sizes.
- Large population centers.
- Higher number of deaf residential-based and daytime schools.
- Gallaudet University likely have had a role in creation of deaf communities along the East Coast over time.

Closing of Deaf residential schools for the Deaf

- Likely have no impact on the student diversity and enrollment at Gallaudet University.

Formal researches is recommended:

- To determine the impacts of schools for the Deaf closing on university enrollments.
- To study the student populations across the U.S. and identify any possible recruiting gaps.
