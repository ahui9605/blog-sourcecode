Welcome to my blog, my name is Zehui. Currently I am a senior student at Gallaudet University majoring in IT. This is just a very simple blog where I could share my knowledges and experiences through completing college assignments and discovering many other new things online. I will upload some articles and useful information contents periodically. I hope you enjoy it!
